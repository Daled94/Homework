## This image inspires me by reminding me to always keep pushing no matter how hard it gets, if you continue to push during the hard times at the end of those moments you will be rewarded for not giving up and continuing to put your best effort in no matter the circumstance, my goal with this course is to learn python and data analytics, and afterwards continue to learn more programs/software in the IT field.
